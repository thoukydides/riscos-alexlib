# AlexLib #

:warning: **The author is no longer developing for RISC OS, so this code is provided as-is without support.** :warning:

AlexLib is a library consisting of an eclectic collection of assembler, C and C++ source code. It was original developed for personal use, but has been released under the GNU General Public License to enable a similar release of other software that uses it.

The components of this library were developed over a long period of time, and contain several experiments in software design, not all of which were necessarily successful or completed. As such it should not be treated as an example of elegant or efficient coding. New software should probably not use this library.

These source files have been rearranged to make them more convenient to navigate and view on non RISC OS platforms. Most significantly, instead of the RISC OS convention of using separate directories for different source file types, more traditional file extensions have been used. The Makefile has not been updated to match these changes, so the code will not build without some modification.
